# Methoda-Task

In order to run this dockerized project:

- Clone the repository to your Linux environment.
- Make sure you have `docker engine` and `docker-compose` installed.
- `cd` into the directory.
- Run the following (with sudo if needed):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Wait until all the node modules install (may take a bit for react).


Once it's done installing, the frontend, backend and MongoDB should run successfully.

You can acccess the app from http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
